> Binary classification with different Machine Learning algorithms

* Examine the performance of a set of supervised learning binary classification algorithms on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.
* Determine which ML model performs the best at predicting cancer type.
* My first Machine Learning Project.
