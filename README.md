### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with a strong background in Mechanical Engineering, Nuclear Energy, Finance, and Data Science. With over two years of experience as a software engineer, I've honed my skills in Python, machine learning, data presentation, and cloud technologies. I have consistently focused on entrepreneurship, problem-solving and clear communication. I am here to discuss any business ideas, work on a project together, or discuss the future of industries: manufacturing, energy, IT, finance, entertainment, and AI.

I'm passionate about product management in the IT industry, where I can contribute to a team of individuals ready to tackle the world's biggest challenges. My goal is to work as a product manager, driving growth and innovation in tech-focused companies before eventually starting my venture.

My unique blend of technical expertise, effective communication, and structured work approach allows me to excel in fast-paced environments. I'm known for my adaptability, quick learning, and ability to convey complex technical concepts to expert developers and business stakeholders.

If you're interested in discussing the future of technology, AI, or product management, please reach out! Let's shape the future of tech together.
